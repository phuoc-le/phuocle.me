## Hello!

Welcome to **phuocle.me** — my personal blog about DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and software engineering.

I created this blog to share knowledge, hands-on experience, and lessons learned from building and maintaining production systems. I hope the posts here will be useful to you on your own journey.

## Why I Write

Writing is one of the best ways to:

- **Solidify knowledge**: If you can explain it to others, you truly understand it
- **Share experience**: Mistakes I've made can help others avoid the same pitfalls
- **Build community**: Connect with like-minded engineers passionate about infrastructure

## What You'll Find Here

This blog focuses on:

1. **DevOps & CI/CD** - Pipelines, GitOps, automation
2. **Cloud Infrastructure** - AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes
3. **Monitoring & Observability** - Prometheus, Grafana, alerting
4. **Tips & Tricks** - Practical advice to boost your productivity

## A Quick Code Snippet to Start

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Deploy to production with confidence
echo "Hello from phuocle.me! 🚀"

kubectl get pods -n production
terraform plan -out=tfplan
echo "Infrastructure is code. Code is life."
```
